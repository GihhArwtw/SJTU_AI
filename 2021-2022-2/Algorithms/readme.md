# Algorithm （算法分析与设计）

I took the course given by Dr. Chihao Zhang（张驰豪）.

## Codes

Note that all codes are solutions to some problems on SJTU ACM OJ.

The pattern of the filenames is as follows.

[Homework ID]-[Problem ID on ACM OJ],[date].cpp

*e.g.*
Code `04-1433,0416.cpp` is the solution to Problem 1433 on SJTU ACM OJ, which is a part of Homework 04. I accomplished AC on the problem at Apr. 16th.

不要直接抄代码哦，这门课有代码查重的，嗯。
