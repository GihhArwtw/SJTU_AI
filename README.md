# SJTU_AI

Notes and assignments during my time in SJTU as a student of AI class.

[Still working on it.] 

在交大人工智能班学习时的一些笔记和作业。

【还在龟速扫描和上传中】


## A Brief Introduction

I am deeply honored that you are browsing this page and I really hope some of notes or codes in this repository are helpful. 
Nevertheless, when you cite something from this project, please remember to list this site as a source.

Notes during my time as freshman and sophomore are mostly on paper and thus, some notes are `pdf` files of hand-written notes scanned. 

**Correctness are not guaranteed for all notes or assignments.**
I have briefly checked most notes before updating, especailly those in English. 
Still, there might exist typos, syntax errors or some words misused. **Note that most notes are in Chinese.**

For some courses, assignments and my version of solutions are also given. 
Assignment during the second semister when I was sophomore are accomplished by LaTex. 
For these assignments, original `tex` files are also uploaded.

Please enjoy. Comments and suggestions are welcome.



## 简介

这里是交大的上课笔记和部分课程的作业。目前大三（我好老）。希望本仓库里我的笔记、程序和作业能对你有所帮助。（如果你对此项目中的内容有所参考，还请引用本网址_(:з」∠)_）

大一和大二的笔记基本上都是手写的纸质版本，所以这里上传的也都是扫描件。（刚买平板，所以大三才开始电子化笔记……）

**笔记和作业的准确性无法100%保证。**
部分课程的笔记**会以英文为主**，我水平有限，所以可能存在语法错误和乱用词汇的情况。虽然上传前我自己又大概地检查了一遍，但不排除有错误未被发现的可能性。

大二下的时候，我开始试着用latex作答作业了，所以这部分的作业也会上传`tex`文件。

总之欢迎留言啦（或者找我扩列（？））



## 一些说明
对同专业的学弟学妹：部分课程的授课学期有所改动，如算法分析与设计（Algorithm）在20届是大二下的课程，而从21届起在大二上授课。

部分课程可能已经不再开设，如随机过程（Stochastic Process），我们（20届）貌似是有这节课的最后一届。
