# SJTU_AI

Notes and assignments during my time in SJTU as a student of AI class.

在交大人工智能班学习时的一些笔记和作业。

[Still working on it.] 【还在龟速扫描和上传中】


## A Brief Introduction

I am deeply honored that you are browsing this page and I really hope some of notes or codes in this repository are helpful. 
Nevertheless, when you cite something from this project, please remember to list this site as a source.

Notes during my time as freshman and sophomore are mostly on paper and thus, some notes are pdf files of hand-written notes scanned. 

*Correctness are not guaranteed for all notes or assignments.* 
I have briefly checked most notes before updating, especailly those in English. 
Still, there might exist typos, syntax errors or some words misused. *Note that most notes are in Chinese.*

For some courses, assignments and my version of answers are also given. 
Assignment during the second semister when I was sophomore are accomplished by LaTex. 
For these assignments, original '.tex' files are also uploaded.

Please enjoy. Comments and suggestions are welcome.



## 简介

这里是交大的上课笔记和部分课程的作业。目前大三（我好老）。希望本仓库里我的笔记、程序和作业能对你有所帮助。（如果你对此项目中的内容有所参考，还请引用本网址_(:з」∠)_）

大一和大二的笔记基本上都是手写的纸质版本，所以这里上传的也都是扫描件。

*笔记和作业的准确性无法100%保证。*
部分课程的笔记可能会以英文为主，我水平有限，所以可能存在语法错误和乱用词汇的情况。

大二下的时候，我开始试着用latex作答作业了，所以这部分的作业也会上传tex文件。

总之欢迎留言啦（或者找我扩列（？））
