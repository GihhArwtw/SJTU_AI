# AI1603: AI Programming Practice（人工智能编程实践）

I took the course given by Dr. Nanyang Ye.

If you really need the original `ipynb` files of all notes in this course, you could contact me through e-mails.
However, I strongly recommend you to try on your own. It is a fantastic way to quickly learn a new computer language, especially for language like python.

Have a little try on it and you will have a command of it.

Our project focused on adversarial attack on number predictor trained on MNIST.

本门课由叶南阳老师讲授。

笔记很多显然是`ipynb`文件转成的`pdf`文件。如果你需要原始的`ipynb`文件，请邮件联系我。
但我真的**强烈建议你自己尝试一下**，这是快速上手某一种语言的最好方式（在百度/CSDN的帮助下自己尝试）。

我们当时的大作业是尝试一下对MNIST数据集上训练的数字识别器进行对抗攻击，后续也试了对抗学习。
